# Solaris-11-STIG
A bash script written for Solaris 11 to check all the DISA STIGs for the Oracle Solaris 11 STIG from 2018. 

## Running

Run this as you would any bash script. It was designed for use on systems that do not have internet connectivity, such as a SCIF, and can be run against any number of hosts. With some simple changes, you can run from one system against hundreds of Solaris hosts and have the output file sent to one location, or split it up by host.
